Experimental scattering data for silica nanoparticles collected over multiple campaigns.

Scattering data is in xenocs .dat format - first lines of file are metadata, followd by whitespace delimited q/I data.

Sample composition in csv file. 

Samples are indexed by uuid - scattering corresponding to a composition in table is in file named with uuid. 

Some samples listed in the csv table do not have scattering data files b/c the experiment did not complete.
